### **1. CI/CD Deployment Pipeline with CodeDeploy and CodePipeline**
Built a fully automated CI/CD pipeline using CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy, enabling seamless deployments from Amazon S3 to EC2 with zero downtime.
Configured Amazon CloudWatch for real-time monitoring and integrated SNS notifications to ensure visibility and prompt incident response during deployments.
Enabled S3 versioning for centralized code management, allowing quick rollback to stable versions and improving release reliability.
Implemented automated testing and build validation in CodeBuild to catch issues early and maintain production stability.
