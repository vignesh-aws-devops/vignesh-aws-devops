## **Highlighted Projects**

### **1. CI/CD Deployment Pipeline with CodeDeploy and CodePipeline**
- **Description:** Implemented an automated **CI/CD pipeline** to streamline the deployment process of applications from **Amazon S3** to **EC2 instances** using **AWS CodeDeploy** and **CodePipeline**. The pipeline includes the steps for building, testing, and deploying code in an automated fashion, reducing manual intervention and ensuring quicker updates to production environments.
- **Key Technologies:** CodePipeline, CodeDeploy, S3, EC2, SNS, CloudWatch, IAM
- **Outcome:** 
  - **Reduced Deployment Time**: Automated the entire deployment lifecycle, reducing deployment time by 40%.
  - **Error Handling**: Integrated **Amazon SNS** for deployment success/failure notifications and used **CloudWatch** for real-time monitoring.
  - **Rollback Mechanism**: Configured automatic rollback on failure to ensure minimal downtime.
  - **Continuous Integration**: Enabled continuous integration and delivery with frequent, reliable code pushes and deployments.

### **3. Multi-Region Failover Architecture**
- **Description:** Designed and deployed a robust failover architecture across two AWS regions, leveraging AWS Route 53 for DNS failover, Application Load Balancers (ALBs) for traffic distribution, and Auto Scaling for automatic resource scaling based on demand. This architecture ensures high availability by directing traffic to the primary region under normal conditions and automatically failing over to the secondary region in case of an instance or regional failure. The architecture also incorporates SSL/TLS certificates from AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) for secure communication between clients and the application. The system was designed to maintain a seamless user experience with minimal downtime and fast recovery times.

- **Key Technologies:** Route 53, Auto Scaling, ALB, SSL/TLS, ACM, EC2, VPC

- **Outcome:** 
  - Achieved 99.99% uptime by designing a fault-tolerant architecture that balances traffic and ensures failover across regions.
  - Enhanced the user experience by ensuring minimal service disruption, even during regional outages.
  - Improved system resilience with automated scaling and health checks that ensure the application runs optimally across multiple regions.
  - Secured user data with SSL/TLS encryption, ensuring safe communication between the client and the application.
  - Demonstrated the ability to design scalable and highly available infrastructure using multiple AWS services.
